Ayman and his other friends planned to play cricket.
They tossed a coin to decide between batting and balling.
Ayman got an idea to create a virtual coin in python GUI programming.
He created a GUI program with a button toss and each time he clicks the button
he gets a random side of the coin. Create the same program and toss the coin.
