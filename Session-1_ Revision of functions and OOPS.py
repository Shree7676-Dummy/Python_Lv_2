Sharma loves to travel in different countries and he uses different currencies in different countries. 
Sometimes he gets confused related to the conversion of the money. So to help Sharma write a program in python
with functions that can take three parameters: amount, from_currency ( currency that has to be converted ), 
to_currency ( Currency in which it has to be converted). The function should return the amount after conversion.
The program should contain at least four different types of currencies.
