Anil wants to calculate the tax to be paid on his earnings. 
He doesnâ€™t remember the amount charged on the earnings. 
So he decided to create a program in python with functions to 
calculate the tax to be paid on his earnings. He collected the 
information and started creating the program and now he is happy to use the calculator. 
Create the same kind of program so that you can use it in the future.

Chris loves open-world games. He wants to create an open-world game 
in python where initially he wants to put random vehicles like trucks, cars, 
vans, ambulances, police cars, SUVs, taxis, etc. on the street. He decided to

Help Chris in doing the same.
