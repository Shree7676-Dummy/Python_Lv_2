Kunal wants to create a password for his social media account. For his password, he wants to use only characters that occur in his name. He wants to use the characters K, U, N, A, and L. He wondered how many possible passwords are there if the length of the password can be anything with no repetition of characters. Write a python program and use recursion to find the answer of the same question. Also, check how many passwords are possible with the characters of your name. Print all the passwords on the screen.
